# Tic-Tac-Toe-Bot
Greetings!
I made a little tic tac toe bot in pygame using minimax and alpha beta pruning for 3x3 5x5 7x7 and 9x9.
3x3 and 5x5 work without problems, 7x7 technically too, note that a bot move requires more than 30 seconds. 
As you probably know 3x3 is not winnable, the bot is however too weak to always draw or win on 5x5 and 7x7. But its not easy so you have to lay out a quite complex trap.
The 9x9 is more of a joke, the bot will only block very obvious attempts to win, its very easy.

Python modules used:
- Pygame 2.0.1
- CxFreeze 6.8.1 (only for exe build)

Have Fun!
